# Pystudio

## Description

## How to run the project

```bash
npm run electron-dev
```

## Requirements

Currently this only runs on the Linux / Mac. You will need to have python3 installed and have it linked via python 3. You can then go to the menu and select new project and select a folder in which you wish to create your project in. After doing this, pystudio will init files and the python env that will be needed for it to run.

## How to build the project

// TODO: include the bash code to run the build
